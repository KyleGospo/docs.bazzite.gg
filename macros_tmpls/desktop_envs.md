### Desktop Environments

All of the images come with the choice of [KDE Plasma](https://kde.org/plasma-desktop/) or
[GNOME](https://www.gnome.org/) for their desktop environment.

[Steam Gaming Mode](https://github.com/KyleGospo/gamescope-session) is an option and is recommended for HTPC setups.

More information can be found on our [FAQ](https://faq.bazzite.gg) about the differences between the image variants.
